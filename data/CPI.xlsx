Nepal Rastra Bank has updated the base year of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to 2023/24. Prior to this, such base year was 2014/15.
The  household  expenditure  weights  used  for  this  index  are  derived  from  the  fourth  Nepal  Living Standards Survey (NLSS-IV), conducted by the National Statistics Office in the fiscal year 2022/23. In the updated Consumer Price Index, the weight for the food and beverage group is 35.49 percent and for the non-food and services group is 64.51 percent. Previously, alcoholic drinks, tobacco products, and restaurants and hotels were included in the food and beverages group. However, in the updated index, these  items  have  been  reclassified  under  the  non-food  and  services  group  in  accordance  with  the COICOP (Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose) 2018 standard.
Price of 525 items is collected from weighted basket of 249 commodities to compute the price index. Of these,  price of 59  items  is  collected weekly,  94  monthly,  and 372 quarterly.  The   price index  is computed at the provincial level as well.
For price collection, 87 market centers have been selected across all 77 districts, including 28 from the Terai, 43 from the hill, and 16 from the mountain region. Among these, 21 are rural market centers and 66 are urban. These market centers on provincial basis consists of 15 in Koshi, 12 in Madhesh, 16 in Bagmati, 11 in Gandaki, 13 in Lumbini, and 10 each in Karnali and Sudurpaschim.

Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has been publishing the summary of the Balance of Payments (BOP) as per the IMF's Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). NRB had started publishing the summary  of  BOP  as  per  the  IMF's  Balance  of  Payments  and  International  Investment  Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) by mapping the standard components from the BPM5  table, since August  2020.  From 2024/25,  NRB  has  started  publishing  the  country's  BOP  as  per  BPM6  and International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) Guidelines, 2022 which is based on BPM6.
The presentation format is different in BPM6 table from that of BPM5. In the BPM6 table, credit entries and debit entries in the current and capital account are presented in columns. The financial account  uses the  headings ""net  acquisition of financial assets"" and  ""net  incurrence  of liabilities"" instead of ""debits"" and ""credits"". Both credit and debit entries in the current and capital account are presented with a positive (+) sign. In the financial account, increase in assets/liabilities is presented with a positive (+) sign, and decrease in assets/liabilities is presented with a negative (-) sign.
In the current account, current account balance is calculated as credits minus debits. In the financial account,  net  lending/net  borrowing  is calculated  as  net  acquisition of financial  assets  minus  net incurrence of liabilities. In the ""changes in reserves net"", positive number denotes the BOP surplus and negative number denotes the BOP deficit.
Some components, which were previously consolidated under a single heading in the BPM5 Table, have now been disaggregated into multiple headings and some have been reclassified. Therefore, certain components in the BPM6 (mapping) Table, published previously before July 2024, are not directly comparable  to  those  in recently published  BPM6  Table.  Caution  should  be  taken while directly comparing such components.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
